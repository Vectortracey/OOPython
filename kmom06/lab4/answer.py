# Create a small phonebook using a dictionary. Use the names as keys and

# Use
#
# > Chandler, Monica, Ross
#
# and corresponding numbers
#
# > 55523645, 55564452, 55545872

# Add the phonenumbers as integers. Answer with the resulting dictionary.

# Write your code below and put the answer into the variable ANSWER.
